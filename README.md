# OpenAPI Specs

Welcome to dlt's "openapi-specs" repository! This repository hosts a collection of OpenAPI specifications designed to be used with our OpenAPI pipeline generator. These specs provide a structured way to interact with various APIs using a standard format.

## About OpenAPI

OpenAPI Specifications (OAS) define a standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, additional documentation, or through network traffic inspection.

## Using the Specs

Each spec in this repository is ready to be used with the OpenAPI pipeline generator to isntantly create robust data pipelines. You can use these specs to automatically generate pipeline code and documentation.

### OpenAPI Pipeline Generator

To start generating your data pipelines from these OpenAPI specs, visit our [dlt-init-openapi repo](https://github.com/dlt-hub/dlt-init-openapi)

This tool allows you to:

- Generate Python scripts for data pipelines directly from OpenAPI specs.
- Customize and optimize the generated pipelines to suit your specific needs.

## Contribute

We encourage the community to contribute to this repository! If you have an OpenAPI spec that you've created or found useful, please consider sharing it here.
